                        <h3>Why is GIT better than Subversion?
                        </h3>SVN vs. Git Branching. One of the most common complaints about SVN is its tedious branching and complicated merging model. ... In Git, branches are only references to a certain commit, making them lightweight yet powerful. Git allows you to create, delete, and change a branch anytime without affecting the commits.

                        <h3>Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website accessible.
                        </h3>WAI-ARIA stands for “Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications”. It is a set of attributes to help enhance the semantics of a web site or web application to help assistive technologies, such as screen readers for the blind, make sense of certain things that are not native to HTML. Screen reader users can use heading structure to navigate content. By using headings (h1, h2, etc.) correctly and strategically, the content of your website will be well-organized and easily interpreted by screen readers.  Choose a content management system that supports accessibility. Use headings correctly to organize the structure of your content. Include proper alt text for images. Give your links unique and descriptive names. Use color with care.
